 * Slab allocator, for system structures.
 * 
 * This allocator manages 1KiB slabs of physical memory, and
 * allocates them out in chunks of 32-bytes.
 * 
 * Since a few system structures are larger than a single
 * chunk, it supports efficient allocation / deallocation
 * of contiguous chunks.
 * 
 * **Note**: The implementation of this is built around pmm
 * managing 1KiB pages - if that should change, this will
 * need some work too!
